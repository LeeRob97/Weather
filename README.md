# Weather

This project is an entry level project as part of my introduction into SwiftUI. I followed [Sean Allen - SwiftUI Basics Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXoVSbwWUIk&list=PLaJMwjTHyw491B5ciCM3sahZre2N8Ibk-&index=5) for this introduction. 

This weather app is mostly composed of static views, and state variables. The UI is similar to Apple's weather app, but very minimal.
